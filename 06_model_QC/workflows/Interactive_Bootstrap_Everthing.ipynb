    "#### Bootstrap\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty in the sample statistics\n",
    "* one source of uncertainty is the paucity of data.\n",
    "* do 200 or even less wells provide a precise (and accurate estimate) of the mean? standard deviation? skew? P13?\n",
    "\n",
    "Would it be useful to know the uncertainty in these statistics due to limited sampling?\n",
    "* what is the impact of uncertainty in the mean porosity e.g. 20%+/-2%?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bootstrap** is a method to assess the uncertainty in a sample statistic by repeated random sampling with replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions\n",
    "* sufficient, representative sampling, identical, idependent samples\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations\n",
    "1. assumes the samples are representative \n",
    "2. assumes stationarity\n",
    "3. only accounts for uncertainty due to too few samples, e.g. no uncertainty due to changes away from data\n",
    "4. does not account for boundary of area of interest \n",
    "5. assumes the samples are independent\n",
    "6. does not account for other local information sources\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bootstrap Approach (Efron, 1982)\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical resampling procedure to calculate uncertainty in a calculated statistic from the data itself.\n",
    "* Does this work?  Prove it to yourself, for uncertainty in the mean solution is standard error: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sigma^2_\\overline{x} = \\frac{\\sigma^2_s}{n}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Extremely powerful - could calculate uncertainty in any statistic!  e.g. P13, skew etc.\n",
    "* Would not be possible access general uncertainty in any statistic without bootstrap.\n",
    "* Advanced forms account for spatial information and sampling strategy (game theory and Journelâ€™s spatial bootstrap (1993).\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. assemble a sample set, must be representative, reasonable to assume independence between samples\n",
    "\n",
    "2. optional: build a cumulative distribution function (CDF)\n",
    "    * may account for declustering weights, tail extrapolation\n",
    "    * could use analogous data to support\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For $\\ell = 1, \\ldots, L$ realizations, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * For $i = \\alpha, \\ldots, n$ data, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "        * Draw a random sample with replacement from the sample set or Monte Carlo simulate from the CDF (if available). \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Calculate a realization of the sammary statistic of interest from the $n$ samples, e.g. $m^\\ell$, $\\sigma^2_{\\ell}$. Return to 3 for another realization.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Compile and summarize the $L$ realizations of the statistic of interest.\n",

    "Some observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* sampling distribution for proportions become discrete with too fee samples, only n cases are possible\n",

    "#### Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a simple demonstration of interactive plots in Jupyter Notebook Python with the ipywidgets and matplotlib packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have many other demonstrations on data analytics and machine learning, e.g. on the basics of working with DataFrames, ndarrays, univariate statistics, plotting data, declustering, data transformations, trend modeling and many other workflows available at https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/PythonNumericalDemos and https://github.com/GeostatsGuy/GeostatsPy. \n",
